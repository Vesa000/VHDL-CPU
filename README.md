# VHDL-Processor
This is a 32bit processor for Arty A7 board.

### Architecture

</p>
The processor has 4 stage pipeline:
- Fetch - reads the next instruction and passes it to Decode stage and moves PC according to instructions.
- Decode - reads registers needed for the instruction.
- Execute - Excecutes all instruction except for the jump instructions.
- Write Back - Stores the values from Execute or memory into registers according to instruction.

### Machine instructions
Instructions follow the format below:
<p align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/n77xAZo.png">
</p>
 - Bits 28-31 tell the Execute Under which condition the instruction should be executed
 - Bits 23-27 tell which instruction should be executed
 - Bits 0-22 Hold instruction specific data for the execute step.

#### Conditions
Conditions tell under which condition the instruction should be executed.
|Value|Condition|Behavior|
|------|-----------|--------|
|0|ALW|Always execute|
|1|EQ|Execute when comparison returned equals|
|2|NEQ|Execute when comparison returned not equals|
|3|GT|Execute when comparison returned greater than|
|4|GEQ|Execute when comparison returned greater or equals|
|5|LT|Execute when comparison returned less than|
|6|LEQ|Execute when comparison returned less or equals|
|15|NOP|Do not execute|

#### Memory Map
Ram I/O and Uart are all mapped into memory and can be accessed with Load and Store instructions
|Address|Location|
|------|---------|
|0-65535|Ram|
|0|Program start instruction|
|65536|Uart Data|
|65537|Uart Status|
|65538-65552|I/O|
|65538|Buttons|
|65539|Switches|
|65540|Leds|
|65541-65552|RGB-Leds|

#### ALU Instructions
Alu instructions have Alu instruction field on bits 0-3 that determines which instruction is excecuted.
|Value|Name|Behavior|
|-----|----|--------|
|0000|ADD|Register A + Register B into Register Q|
|0001|SUB|Register A - Register B into Register Q|
|0010|DIV|Register A / Register B into Register Q|
|0011|MUL|Register A * Register B into Register Q|
|0100|CMP|Sets Equals, Greater than and Less than flags for conditional instructions|


### Assembly Instructions
|Instruction|Usage|Behaviour|
|-----------|-----|---------|
|LDV|LDV 1 2|Load value 1 to register 2|
|LDR|LDR 1 2|Load memory address 1 to register 2|
|STR|STR 1 2|Store register 1 to memory address 2|
|MOV|MOV 1 2|Move value from register 1 to register 2|
|JMP|JMP LABEL|Jump to label|
|BRA|BRA LABEL|Jump to label and store Program Counter to stack|
|RET|RET| Load value from stack to PC|
|ADD|ADD 1 2 3|Reg 3 = reg1 + reg 2|
|SUB|SUB 1 2 3|Reg 3 = reg1 - reg 2|
|MUL|MUL 1 2 3|Reg 3 = reg1 * reg 2|
|DIV|DIV 1 2 3|Reg 3 = reg1 / reg 2|
|CMP|CMP 1 2|Compare reg 1 to reg 2|
|NOP|NOP|Do nothing|
|HLT|HLT|Stop|

### Example code
Following code writes Fibonacci sequence to Uart

```
	LDV	0	1		// i
	LDV	1	2		// j

FIBONACCI:
	ADD	1	2	3	//k=i+j
	MOV	2	1		//i=j
	MOV	3	2		//j=k

	MOV	2	10		//Write j
	BRA PRINT
	LDV	10	10		//Write \n
	BRA PRINT
	LDV	13	10		//Write \r
	BRA PRINT
	JMP	FIBONACCI

PRINT:
	LDR	65537	4	// Uart status to reg 4
	LDV	1	5		// Uart Ready value to reg 5
	CMP	4	5
NEQ	JMP	PRINT		// Wait untill uart is ready
	STR	10	65536	// Write reg 10 to uart
	RET
```
